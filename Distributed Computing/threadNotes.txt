Threads

-Processes with very little private memory are called threads or light-weight processes. At a minimum, each thread needs a program counter and a place in memory for its stack. 

-Two ways to create threads in Java, by Java class:Thread and by Java interface: Runnable. The Java class:Thread also implements the interface: Runnable.

Runnable:

public interface Runnable {
  public abstract void run();
}

This means to create a thread we need to implement the method: run()
